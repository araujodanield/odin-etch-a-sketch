# Etch-a-Sketch Online

Fourth project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a> course.

This is a little drawing app based on the Etch-a-Sketch toy that allows you to create pixel arts on a canvas that goes from 2x2 to 100x100 pixels. 

As an extra challenge to the project I've made almost every HTML elements of the page using DOM manipulation. 

The logic applied on the canvas uses CSS Grid.
